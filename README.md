<h1>macecoreâš¡</h1>

This is a clientside utility mod for **MACE combat** that allows you to use the mace and related items to their full potential without the hassle of rattling your brain to the core. This is intended for small scale singleplayer worlds and small scale servers.

If installed serverside, This mod acts as its own anti-cheat and searches for its own packet (macecore:macecore-rep) to remove you from the server. This packet will not be present if you compile the mod from source or get it from my patreon.

Here is a rundown of everything included within this mod:
